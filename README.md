| Method | Path                      | Description                          | Success Status |
|--------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
| GET    | `/api/tasks`               | Get all tasks                         | 200 |
| GET    | `/api/tasks/{id}`          | Get a single task by ID               | 200 |
| POST   | `/api/tasks`                | Create a new task                     | 201 |
| PUT    | `/api/tasks/{id}`          | Update an existing task               | 200 |
| DELETE | `/api/tasks/{id}`          | Delete a task                         | 204 |

All task fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `completed`.

## How to Run

### Locally (Maven)
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
App runs on `localhost:8080` by default (or whatever `server.port` is set to in `application.properties`).

### With Docker
```
docker build -t task-api:v1 .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8081 task-api:v1
```
Note: the app listens on port 8081 inside the container; the command above maps host port 8080 to it.

### With Docker Compose
```
docker compose up
```
Builds and runs the app in one command. A placeholder for a Postgres service is left in `docker-compose.yml` for Week 3, when persistent storage gets added.

## Architecture

The project follows a layered structure:

- **Controller** (`TaskController`) — handles HTTP requests only: receives input, calls the service, returns a response. No business logic lives here.
- **Service** (`TaskService`) — holds the actual business logic (creating, updating, fetching, deleting tasks).
- **Repository** (`TaskRepository`) — handles data storage. Currently in-memory; will move to PostgreSQL in Week 3.
- **Exception handling** — a custom `TaskNotFoundException` paired with a `GlobalExceptionHandler` turns errors into clean, consistent HTTP responses (404 for missing tasks, 400 for validation failures), instead of leaking raw stack traces.
- **Validation** — request bodies are validated using `@Valid` (Jakarta Validation) before reaching the service layer.
- **Configuration** — settings like the welcome message are externalized into `application.properties` rather than hardcoded, using `@Value`.

This separation keeps each layer responsible for exactly one thing, and makes the code easier to test and extend (e.g. swapping the in-memory repository for a database-backed one later without touching the controller or service).

## Concepts Learned

### Request Lifecycle
A request travels: Browser → `DispatcherServlet` (Spring's front controller, routes incoming requests) → the matching `@RestController` method → business logic in the service layer → response serialized back to JSON.

### Bean
A Bean is a single Java object that Spring creates and manages at runtime — instead of the class creating its own dependencies with `new`, Spring builds it once and hands it out wherever it's needed (e.g. `TaskService`, `TaskController`).

### Application Context
The Application Context is where Spring keeps all the Beans it has built — a container/storage that holds every managed object. When a class needs a Bean, Spring retrieves it from the Application Context rather than creating a new one on the spot.

### Singleton vs Prototype Scope
- **Singleton** (the default): Spring creates exactly one instance of a Bean and shares that same object everywhere it's needed.
- **Prototype**: Spring creates a brand new instance every single time the Bean is requested, with no sharing between callers.

Most Beans in this project (like `TaskService`) are singletons — safe because they don't hold per-request state, just logic and a reference to the repository.
